% use Times
\usepackage{times}
% For figures
\usepackage{graphicx} % more modern
%\usepackage{epsfig} % less modern
\usepackage{subfigure} 

% For citations
\usepackage{natbib}

% For algorithms
\usepackage{algorithm}
\usepackage{algorithmic}

% As of 2011, we use the hyperref package to produce hyperlinks in the

% following usepackage line and replace \usepackage{icml2014} with

\usepackage{hyperref}

% Packages hyperref and algorithmic misbehave sometimes.  We can fix
% this with the following command.
\newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}
