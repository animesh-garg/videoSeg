\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
We were able to give a global optimization formulation for the problem of video segmentation where the objective was independently convex over two sets of variables. We used a block-coordinate descent method based solver for this global optimization problem and experimented with different formulations which resulted in different performances and accuracies. We observe that our algorithm is limited by the computational resources available and even though the global formulation would probably give better results, it still is a long way from being applied in practice because of the prohibhitive computational costs. We believe that the relaxations used in this work to arrive at a formulation of the problem as an $LP$ are general enough to capture the problem of video segmentation and can be leveraged in future work with better computational resources and hyper-parameter tuning to achieve state of the art results.
