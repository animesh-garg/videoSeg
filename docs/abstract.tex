Getting exact video segmentations for tracking and recognition is a challenging problem. 
A majority of existing methodstrack but provide a bounding box rather than a an exact foreground
mask for the object. For real worl applications of perception, like robotics, the silhoutte of the object
perhaps even pose need to be known for hope of success in manipulation tasks.

We propose a method in this study which formulated the problem of video segmentation
as a Markov random field. However solving such a large graph to global optimality may 
be computationally expensive. Hence we propose a distributed method using Primal 
decomposition.
