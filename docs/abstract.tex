Getting exact video segmentations for tracking and recognition is a challenging problem. 
A majority of existing methods can track objects in video but provide a bounding box rather than a an exact foreground
mask for the object. However, for real world applications of perception, like robotics, the silhoutte of an object
and perhaps even the pose need to be known for hope of success in manipulation tasks.

In this study, we propose a method for formulating the problem of video segmentation
as a Markov random field. Solving such a large graph problem to global optimality may 
be computationally expensive or even intractable. Hence we propose Primal decomposition method for breaking the nonconvex objective into two convex subproblems which can be minimized in alternation to find a local minimum of the objective.
