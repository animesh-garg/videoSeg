\section{Introduction}

The problem of video segmentation is of interest for many areas. 
\cite{Komodakis2007a, Komodakis2011a} and \cite{Tsai2010}
have looked at the problem of modelling the MRF in terms of energies. 
The solution strategy they use is Dual decomposition but without integer programming.

Our study explores the use of state-of-the-art integer program solvers. Modelling integers
allows us to capture more rich features in video which are usually not directly put in current 
models. 
From a given video sequence, and user intialized object(s)
of interest, the aim is to track the region(s) of interest through
the subsequent image frames in the video. Majority of other
methods which address the problem provide locally optimal
solutions. Such an approach though successful in some applications
requires a substantial amount of human intervention
at several points in the solution such as in cases of occlusion,
change in pose, shape and color and in extreme cases object
(or a part of object) egresses the frame and re-enters later.
