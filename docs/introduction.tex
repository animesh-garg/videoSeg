\section{Introduction}

The problem of video segmentation is of interest for many areas. 
Previous works \cite{Komodakis2007a, Komodakis2011a} \cite{Tsai2010}
have looked at the problem of modelling the Markov Random Field (MRF) in terms of energies. 
Their solution strategy is Dual decomposition over the space of continuous variables, despite the fact that the optimization problem is inherently combinatorial.

Our study explores the use of state-of-the-art integer program solvers. Modelling integers
allows us to capture more rich features in video which are usually not directly used current 
models. 
From a given video sequence, and user intialized object(s)
of interest, the aim is to track the region(s) of interest through
the subsequent image frames in the video. The majority of other
methods which address the problem provide locally optimal
solutions to an already relaxed optimization problem. Though successful in some applications, such an approach
requires a substantial amount of human intervention
at several points in the solution such as in cases of occlusion,
change in pose, shape and color and in extreme cases object
(or a part of object) egresses the frame and re-enters later.
